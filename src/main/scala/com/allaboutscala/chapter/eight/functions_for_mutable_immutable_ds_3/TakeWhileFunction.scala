  *
  * The takeWhile function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The takeWhile method takes a predicate function and will use it to return a new collection
  * consisting of elements which match the predicate function.
  *
  * def takeWhile(p: (A) â‡’ Boolean): Repr
  *
  * The takeWhile method is a member of IterableLike trait.
