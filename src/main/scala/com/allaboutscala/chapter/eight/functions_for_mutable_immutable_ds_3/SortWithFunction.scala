  *
  * The sortWith function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The sortWith method takes a predicate function and will use it to create a new collection
  * where the elements are sorted by the predicate function.
  *
  * def sortWith(lt: (A, A) â‡’ Boolean): Repr
  *
  * The sortWith method is a member of SeqLike trait.
