  *
  * The scanLeft function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The order for traversing the elements in the collection is from left to right and hence the name scanLeft.
  *
  * Similar to the foldLeft method, scanLeft allows you to also specify an initial value.
  *
  * def scanLeft[B, That](z: B)(op: (B, A) â‡’ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
  *
  * The scanLeft method is a member of TraversableLike trait.
  *
