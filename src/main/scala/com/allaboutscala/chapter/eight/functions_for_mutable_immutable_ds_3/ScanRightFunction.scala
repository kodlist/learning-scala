/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/4/2019.
  *
  * The scanRight function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The scanRight method takes an associative binary operator function as parameter and will
  * use it to collapse elements from the collection to create a running total.
  * The order for traversing the elements in the collection is from right to left and hence
  * the name scanRight.  Similar to the foldRight method, scanRight allows you to
  * also specify an initial value.
  *
  * def scanRight[B, That](z: B)(op: (A, B) â‡’ B)(implicit bf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
  *
  * The scanRight method is a member of TraversableLike trait.
  *
