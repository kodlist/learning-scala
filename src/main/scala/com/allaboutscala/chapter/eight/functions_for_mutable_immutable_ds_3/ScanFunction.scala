/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/4/2019.
  *
  * The scan function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The scan method takes an associative binary operator function as parameter and will use it to
  * collapse elements from the collection to create a running total from each element.
  * Similar to the fold method, scan allows you to also specify an initial value.
  *
  * def scan[B >: A, That](z: B)(op: (B, B) â‡’ B)(implicit cbf: CanBuildFrom[Repr, B, That]): That
  *
  * The scan method is a member of TraversableLike trait.
  *
