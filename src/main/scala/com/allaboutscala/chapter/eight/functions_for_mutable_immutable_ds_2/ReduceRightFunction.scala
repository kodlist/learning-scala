/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/4/2019.
  *
  * The reduceRight function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The reduceRight method takes an associative binary operator function as parameter and will use it to collapse elements from the collection
  * The order for traversing the elements in the collection is from right to left and hence the name reduceRight.
  *
  * Unlike the foldRight method, reduceRight does not allow you to also specify an initial value.
  *
  * def reduceRight[B >: A](op: (B, A) â‡’ B): B
  *
  * The reduceRight method is a member of the TraversableOnce trait.
  *
