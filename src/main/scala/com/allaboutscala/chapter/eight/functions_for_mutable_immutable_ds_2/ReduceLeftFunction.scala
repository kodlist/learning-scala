/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/3/2019.
  *
  * The reduceLeft function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The reduceLeft method takes an associative binary operator function as parameter and will
  * use it to collapse elements from the collection. The order for traversing the elements in the
  * collection is from left to right and hence the name reduceLeft.
  *
  * Unlike the foldLeft method, reduceLeft does not allow you to also specify an initial value.
  *
  * def reduceLeft[B >: A](op: (B, A) â‡’ B): B
  *
  * The reduceLeft method is a member of the TraversableOnce trait.
  *
