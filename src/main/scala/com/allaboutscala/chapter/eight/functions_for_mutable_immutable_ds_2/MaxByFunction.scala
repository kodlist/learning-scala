/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/3/2019.
  *
  * The maxBy function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The maxBy method takes a predicate function as its parameter and applies it to every element in the collection to return the largest element.
  *
  * def maxBy[B](f: (A) â‡’ B): A
  *
  * The maxBy method is a member of the TraversableOnce trait.
