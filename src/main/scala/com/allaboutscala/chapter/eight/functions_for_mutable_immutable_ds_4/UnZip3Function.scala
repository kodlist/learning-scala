  * Created by mkoduri on 10/4/2019.
  *
  *
  *  The unzip3 function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  *  The unzip3 method will un-merge a collection consisting of elements as Tuple3 into three separate collections.
  *
  *  def unzip3[A1, A2, A3](implicit asTriple: (A) â‡’ (A1, A2, A3)): (CC[A1], CC[A2], CC[A3])
  *
  *  The unzip3 method is a member of GenericTraversableTemplate trait.
