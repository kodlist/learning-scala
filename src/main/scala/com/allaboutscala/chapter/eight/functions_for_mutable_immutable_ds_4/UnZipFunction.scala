/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/4/2019.
  *
  * The unzip function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * def unzip[A1, A2](implicit asPair: (A) â‡’ (A1, A2)): (CC[A1], CC[A2])
  *
  * The unzip method is a member of GenericTraversableTemplate trait.
  *
  * The unzip method will unzip and un-merge a collection consisting of element pairs or Tuple2 into two separate collections.
