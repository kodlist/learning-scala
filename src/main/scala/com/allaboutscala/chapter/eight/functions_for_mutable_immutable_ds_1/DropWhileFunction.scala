/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/1/2019.
  *
  * The dropWhile function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The dropWhile method takes a predicate function parameter that will be used to drop certain elements in a collection which satisfies the predicate function.
  * The "dropping" process, or removal of elements, will stop as soon as it encounters an element
  * that does not match the predicate function. Therefore, it will return a new collection with the
  * remaining elements from the original collection starting from the first element that did not match the predicate function.
  *
  *
  * def dropWhile(p: (A) â‡’ Boolean): Repr
  *
  * The dropWhile method is a member of the IterableLike trait.
  *
  * dropWhile takes predicate
  *
  * The predicate function is a Value Function.
