  *
  *
  *  The foldLeft function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  *  The foldLeft method takes an associative binary operator function as parameter and will use it to collapse elements from the collection.
  *
  *  The order for traversing the elements in the collection is from left to right and hence the name foldLeft.
  *
  *  The foldLeft method allows you to also specify an initial value.
  *
  * Using foldLeft is fundamental in recursive function and will help you prevent stack-overflow exceptions.
  *
  * def foldLeft[B](z: B)(op: (B, A) â‡’ B): B
  *
  * The foldLeft method is a member of the TraversableOnce trait.
  *
