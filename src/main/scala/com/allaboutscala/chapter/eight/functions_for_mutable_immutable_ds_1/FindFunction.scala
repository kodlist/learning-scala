/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/2/2019.
  *
  *
  * The find function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The find method takes a predicate function as parameter and uses it to find the first element in the collection which matches the predicate.
  *
  * It returns an Option and as such it may return a None for the case where it does not match any
  * elements in the collection with the predicate function.
  *
  * def find(p: (A) â‡’ Boolean): Option[A]
  *
  * The find method is a member of the TraversableLike trait.
  *
