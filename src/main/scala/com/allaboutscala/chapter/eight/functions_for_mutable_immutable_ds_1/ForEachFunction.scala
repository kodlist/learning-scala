  * The foreach function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The foreach method takes a function as parameter and applies it to every element in the collection.
  *
  * def foreach(f: (A) â‡’ Unit): Unit
  *
  * The foreach method is a member of the IterableLike trait.
