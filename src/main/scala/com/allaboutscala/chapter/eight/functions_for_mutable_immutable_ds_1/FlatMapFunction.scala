/**
  * Created by mkoduri on 10/2/2019.
  *
  *
  * The flatMap function is applicable to both Scala's Mutable and Immutable collection data structures.
  *
  * The flatMap method takes a predicate function, applies it to every element in the collection.
  * It then returns a new collection by using the elements returned by the predicate function.
  * The flatMap method is essentially a combination of the map method being run first followed
  * by the flatten method.
  *
  * def flatMap[B](f: (A) â‡’ GenTraversableOnce[B]): TraversableOnce[B]
  *
  * The flatMap method is a member of the TraversableLike trait
  *
